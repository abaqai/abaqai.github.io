I"î<p>Itâ€™s been a while since I longboarded. Itâ€™s not because I donâ€™t want to, itâ€™s just because one of the cells in the battery is unbalanced and as Jaden Smith once said, â€œLife needs less unbalance and more new balanceâ€. Yeah, he probably never said that but Iâ€™m sure someone from NewBalance thought of that as a slogan. Anyways back to longboarding.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s important to understand that longboarding is different from skateboarding (yes I used the skateboarding emoji, they donâ€™t have one for longboarding). Skateboarding revolves around tricks, jumps, exquisite feet movement, baggy pants, the phrase â€œyeah, just gonna pop shove it over the railing and the rest is YOLOâ€, monster energy drink, broken wrist and much more. Longboarding on the other hand compared to skateboarding is what cricket is to baseball: less ways to get hurt, but all the better and gentlemen-like.</p>

<p>No, but in all seriousness, what is a longboard? Simply, a board with wheels meant to cruise on. Thatâ€™s it. Nothing more, nothing less. You can just stand up, push with your feet and scream â€œYAHOOâ€. Now of course, I mentioned battery, meaning that Iâ€™m not spending time and energy pushing. Iâ€™m speeding down (or up) the streets of Berkeley, with indie music in my ears (sometimes some rap just to bring some hype), with not a worry in the world. Unless of course, I see a giant pothole or crooked part of the road and then Iâ€™m dead. Not literally (Alhamdulillah), but scratches and bruises everywhere. All the less, itâ€™s completely worth it.</p>

<p>So why am I writing all of this? I have no clue. I just miss my longboard and it might be time to get a new battery (for a $100 bucks :( or by trying to get some sponsorship/promocode/college-student/something-something program). But if thereâ€™s one thing to take away after reading this, itâ€™s that you should get a longboard (electric if youâ€™re cool) and just start cruising. Vroom Vroom (but translate that to the electric domain) and God speed.</p>
