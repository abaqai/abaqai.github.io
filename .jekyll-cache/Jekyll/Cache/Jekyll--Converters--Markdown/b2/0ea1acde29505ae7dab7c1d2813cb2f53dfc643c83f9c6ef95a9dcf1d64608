I"÷<p>You might be wondering, why did I recently develop this urge to write a bunch of stuff and post it for everyone to see. To be honest, I donâ€™t know myself. What I write over here could literally have no meaning to you. All I do is transcribe my thoughts from my head to this platform. I donâ€™t even read my drafts sometimes, I just post them. For me, itâ€™s not so much about the style of writing, itâ€™s more about the content (even if my sentence structure may not be grammatically correct).</p>
