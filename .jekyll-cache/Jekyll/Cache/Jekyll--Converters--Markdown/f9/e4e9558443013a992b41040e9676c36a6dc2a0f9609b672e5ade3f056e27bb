I"Ö<p>Letâ€™s talk about <a href="https://www.uefa.com/">Football</a>! Real Football; the sport where you consistently kick the BALL with your FOOT. Now Iâ€™m not an experienced Football pundit, nor am I <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi">Messi</a> who knows the ins and out of the game better than anyone on the pitch but I am a strong supporter of the sport. As someone whoâ€™s not constrained to any specific team (go <a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/">Liverpool</a> and <a href="https://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/">Spurs</a> tho), I find myself watching all the teams in all the leagues: <a href="https://www.premierleague.com/">Premier</a>, La Liga, Serie A, Bundasliga, even MLS from time to time.</p>
