I"B<p>It rained today.</p>

<p>I just wanted you to know because I have this special appreciation for rain. It’s such a cool phenomina. To most people, it’s just water falling from the sky.</p>

<p>But for me, it’s a lot more. Everytime it rains, there’s a cool breeze the flows throughout the house. Mornings aren’t really mornings anymore. The sun isn’t really out. Today, instead of feeling the constant urge to pee, you feel the coziness of your blanket to an extent you’ve never felt before. You’re wrapped tight enough for your body to stay nice and warm, but your face is exposed to that cold 62F air. It’s actually quiet pleasent. After a quick contemplation of those random, scattered thoughts in your brain, you finally decide to get out of bed. It’s at this moment that you start to feel your life changing. The physical change in the atmosphere has created the illusion of emotional and mental change. You’re filled with hope that this day is going to be different than the past days. It’s going to be more exciting, more engaging, more productive. A day where your actions will portray a flow of spantaneuty.</p>

<p>You start boiling water for your morning coffee (instant coffee ofcourse, this is college, we don’t have time for a pour over or a french press). You’re too tired to make breakfast, so you just warm up one of the desi sweets your roommate’s mom left in the fridge for the household. You finally go out to your deck, and that’s when you see the reality of the situation. The Berkeley hills are wet. There’s a certain shine on the nearby trees. There’s people playing spikeball on the glade. It smells moist (I don’t even know if that’s a real smell).</p>

<p>All in all, there’s literally water pouring from the sky. Anything seems possible in this moment :). Life… seems to be good!</p>
