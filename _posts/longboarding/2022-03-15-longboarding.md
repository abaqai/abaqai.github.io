It's been a while since I longboarded. It's not because I don't want to, it's just because one of the cells in the battery is unbalanced and as Jaden Smith once said, "Life needs less unbalance and more new balance". Yeah, he probably never said that but I'm sure someone from NewBalance thought of that as a slogan. Anyways back to longboarding.
 
It's important to understand that longboarding is different from skateboarding (yes I used the skateboarding emoji, they don't have one for longboarding). Skateboarding revolves around tricks, jumps, exquisite feet movement, baggy pants, the phrase "yeah, just gonna pop shove it over the railing and the rest is YOLO", monster energy drink, broken wrist and much more. Longboarding on the other hand compared to skateboarding is what cricket is to baseball: less ways to get hurt, but all the better and gentlemen-like.
 
No, but in all seriousness, what is a longboard? Simply, a board with wheels meant to cruise on. That's it. Nothing more, nothing less. You can just stand up, push with your feet and scream "YAHOO". Now of course, I mentioned battery, meaning that I'm not spending time and energy pushing. I'm speeding down (or up) the streets of Berkeley, with indie music in my ears (sometimes some rap just to bring some hype), with not a worry in the world. Unless of course, I see a giant pothole or crooked part of the road and then I'm dead. Not literally (Alhamdulillah), but scratches and bruises everywhere. All the less, it's completely worth it.
 
So why am I writing all of this? I have no clue. I just miss my longboard and it might be time to get a new battery (for a $100 bucks :( or by trying to get some sponsorship/promocode/college-student/something-something program). But if there's one thing to take away after reading this, it's that you should get a longboard (electric if you're cool) and just start cruising. Vroom Vroom (but translate that to the electric domain) and God speed.
