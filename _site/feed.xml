&lt;p&gt;But apart from being a shade of purple, I define Indigo as a feeling. How come you might ask? Well, if Elvis Presley was having a Blue Christmas, and loving him was Red for Taylor Swift, then why can‚Äôt Indigo be my vibe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I even get into the definition of this vibe, you need to know some things about me. For starters, I‚Äôm a very social person. I live for personal interaction and always try to view life from another‚Äôs perspective. I find this to be very refreshing while also being an opportunity to grow as a person. Additionally, I‚Äôm very optimistic. A little too optimistic some might say. I always try to find a silver lining and tend to ignore the negatives in life (This may not always be a good thing tho).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, now that you know a little bit about my character, I‚Äôll finally try to define Indigo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indigo is going to the nearby coffee shop to work. But instead, you end up sharing your life story with the person right next to you simply because you needed their laptop charger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indigo is going to class and sitting in that open seat next to a stranger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indigo is taking the bus to Trader Joe‚Äôs to find yourself the ingredients for a nice Gouda Grilled cheese. But instead, you end up getting dropped home by a friend of a friend you only met once before and end up sharing your grilled cheese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indigo is walking into a party but leaving 5 minutes later to go to Taco Bell with that one person from your CS class who you‚Äôve always wanted to be partnered with for the weekly lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indigo is finally going to that Coldplay concert and singing the lyrics to Yellow with the person right next to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indigo is the feeling of meeting someone you barely know, but in that moment, you feel as if you‚Äôve spent a lifetime with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you know what Indigo is, go out there and feel it!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ahmed Baqai</name><email>abaq@berkeley.edu</email></author><category term="Life" /><summary type="html">It‚Äôs a beautiful color, Indigo.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Why I Decided to Document My Thoughts</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/why/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why I Decided to Document My Thoughts" /><published>2020-11-05T02:29:20+00:00</published><updated>2020-11-05T02:29:20+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/why</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/why/">&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering, why did I recently develop this urge to write a bunch of stuff and post it for everyone to see. To be honest, I don‚Äôt know myself. What I write over here could literally have no meaning to you. All I do is transcribe my thoughts from my head to this platform. I don‚Äôt even read my drafts sometimes, I just post them. For me, it‚Äôs not so much about the style of writing, it‚Äôs more about the content (even if my sentence structure may not be grammatically correct).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember, someone said something to me once about documenting their thoughts. Our brain is a very complicated system and like a lot of complicated systems, it‚Äôs handling a lot of information at the same time. Often times, our brain gets clogged up with random ideas that God knows where we got from. It‚Äôs helpful to empty out our brain once in a while (or at least provide the illusion of emptying it out). Previously, I would just talk to myself sometimes to do this. I could do it for hours. As Michael Scott once said, ‚ÄúSometimes I‚Äôll start a sentence and I don‚Äôt even know where it‚Äôs going. I just hope I find it along the way.‚Äù That pretty much sums it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never know where these short blurbs are going to end up. I just hope in the end, I‚Äôll have something that I can look back to in the future and contrast it with my future thinking and ideologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you want a glimpse of what goes on in my head, feel free to keep reading! If not, I totally understand. Sometimes, I even don‚Äôt like what‚Äôs going on in my head LMAO.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ahmed Baqai</name><email>abaq@berkeley.edu</email></author><category term="Life" /><summary type="html">You might be wondering, why did I recently develop this urge to write a bunch of stuff and post it for everyone to see.
